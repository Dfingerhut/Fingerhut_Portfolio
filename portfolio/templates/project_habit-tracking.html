                        This project was developed as part of a course on Udemy, designed to introduce me to Flask and Jinja for backend development. The goal was to create a dynamic portfolio while gaining hands-on experience with Flask, a powerful tool for MLOps and API development.  </p>
                    <p>
                        While this may not have the advanced UI of React-based projects, it focuses on showcasing backend skills. Specifically, it demonstrates how data is pushed to MongoDB and accessed to generate dynamic pages. This project serves as a solid foundation for my backend development knowledge and my journey into MLOps and API work.
